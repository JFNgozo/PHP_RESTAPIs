A simple project that makes API calls via a Javascript file.

The javascript route handler gets the request and sends it to a PHP 
interface which analyses the request. It does all the needed verification
and validation. Finally sends calls the right API Interface.

The API Interface class handles extends model classes.

More documentation will be provided. 

Its a project on-going.
